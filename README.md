# Electrate Fuego
Abstract: This repository will allow the user to mix and match div. blocks to build a quick website similar to an Adobe Spark. https://spark.adobe.com, but with an electrate twist...

Hello maker! Welcome to the Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it--for this might be a really intersection on your way to becoming. I use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web doc. that not only introduces you to the other, but explains a little more about the discourse communities that have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual. 

You could do it the easy way like I once did: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/ , or you can do a little more unconcealing...not just unconcealing who you are, but opening these tools that you use everyday, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to really understand our tools and how they work. So let's cut it all open--using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would say...lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! 

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's four discourses of family, entertainment, community, and schooling ((2002). Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy.) Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. I hope you are excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
Get started!

1. Fork this repository.

2. Download the website to a zip file. 

3. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images and pdf's, etcetera. 

4. Download and open a text editor like "brackets.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." 

5. Open the style.css and index.html documents from your computer.  

6. Start reading the index.html in text editor and you can then get started building our own Electrate Fuego!

7. Once you have modified and added your files, return to your repository and upload your files. Hit "Commit!." 

8. To publish, go to the repository settings, scroll down, scroll down, until you see "GitHub Pages." Here you will change "source" from "none" to "master branch." This will publish your Electrate Fuego onbline. It's time to spread the fire! Congratulations.
